# tingappen
Tinget was the vikings Congress, so I wanted the fact that I am Norwegian be a part of the name. Also, "appen" is "the app" in Norwegian, Tingappen is a long time dream of a very useful app I wanted to create mostly for myself, but lets see how it develops.

The license is not yet set because I don't know how this will develop, and it may become a SaaS I want to launch to the public for a low monthly cost.
